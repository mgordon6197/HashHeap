This is a data structure combining a hash table and heap.

I have one class that is a hash table and one class that is a heap.

I have another class called HashHeap that contains both hash table and heap.

the listnode class is used for separate chaining in the hash table.
the 
driver creates the data structure and runs it.

Command Line:

make
./prog1 < file.txt > output.txt
